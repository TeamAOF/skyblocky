Download the curseforge file from the [Relases Page](https://github.com/RobertasJ/skylore/releases/tag/1.6) and upzip it into `C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Curseforge\Minecraft\Instances`. * Note: If you've previously used the Twitch App the path will most likely be `C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Twitch\Minecraft\Instances`.
