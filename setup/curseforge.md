## CurseForge App (Windows / Mac)
1. Download the [CurseForge App](https://curseforge.overwolf.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.

2. Download the curseforge file from the [Relases Page](https://github.com/RobertasJ/skylore/releases/tag/1.3), the default path is `C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Curseforge\Minecraft\Instances`. * Note: If you've previously used the Twitch App the path will most likely be `C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Twitch\Minecraft\Instances`.
3. Double click the script sync.ps1 everytime you want to update the modpack.

4. Open the CurseForge App and you should see the modpack. If you already had CurseForge App open, restart it.
